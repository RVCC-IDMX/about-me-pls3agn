## DESCRIPTION
This project has been a cumulative effort over the course of the fall semester for the IDMX-225-02 Class.  It was a project meant to give students a hands-on way for learning HTML, CSS, and general web development skills.  Over the course of the semester and over the course of working on this project I learned how to implement several different features in HTML and CSS including how to use flexboxes and grids and the box model and how to embed different kinds of media.  

### Color Scheme
My color scheme was created with help from Adobeâ€™s color wheel tool.  I chose a darker color scheme out of personal preference but still made sure that it followed proper accessibility considerations.

The hex codes for all the colors used are as follows:
#3A3A3A
#4A4737
#615B31
#665542
#8A866E
#DFDEDC

### Head
Credit to Google fonts for helping me find the fonts I used.

### Navbar
Turned into a hamburger menu for mobile devices that drops down when clicked on.  

### Hero
A picutre of myself taken by my friend Sophia, and the logo

### Biography
A short biography of myself.

### Info
Some information about my favorite things

### Hobbies
Some information about my hobbies

### Gallery
This is a gallery of 3 pictures, two for the sake of the photo and the last one being of a ring I made.  These are to showcase my two main hobbies which is photography and jewlery making.  The first photo is of a statue called "The Awakening" by Seward Johnson in Hopewell NJ.

### Lit
This is a short blog post I wrote about embedding a static Google Map using iframe.  Credit to Grammarly for helping with grammar/editing.

### Map
This is a demonstration of the blog post and links to RVCC's location on the map.

### Video
This is a commercial that I saw about a million times when I was a little kid for some birthday clown service.  I included it as my video because I like it a lot and it makes me laugh.
